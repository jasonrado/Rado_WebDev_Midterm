       <h3>Calendar with CSS: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/calendarwithcss.html">VIEW HERE</a></h3>

       <p>Calendar with CSS was one of our activities where we implement a CSS in our previous activitiy which is the calendar and since my birthday is 2 days after Halloween so I turned it into a dark and 

some what gross themed website.</p>

       <h3>Google: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2b/images/google.png">VIEW HERE</a></h3>

       <p>Copying google was one of our activities in which we our tasked to copy the google by ourselves but to be honest, I didn't able to copy 

it properly and the alignments/positioning of some parts are bad

because I am very bad at it.</p><hr>

       <img src="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2b/images/invoice.png" id="content_img">

       <h3>Invoice: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2a/receipt_web_view.html">VIEW HERE</a></h3>

       <p>This was part of our exam in which we are assigned to copy a invoice/receipt page based on what we find in the internet. I enjoyed doing this but it was kinda hard to find the same text font and the web view and input form changes the positioning of some text because of the input types.</p><hr>

       <img src="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2b/images/masterdetail.png" id="content_img">

       <h3>Master Detail: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/masterdetail.html">VIEW HERE</a></h3>

       <p>When I made this activity, I really have no idea what and where to start because we have to link all our previous activities in one website and show it in a frame everytime you click an activity page so I ended up searching on the internet how and thanks to it I was able to finish the website.</p><hr>

       <img src="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2b/images/registration.png" id="content_img">

       <h3>Registration: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/registration.html">VIEW HERE</a></h3>

       <p>This was one of our activities in which we are required to make a registration page based

on what we always see online so I mix it with a little bit of what I see in gaming and 

what we always typically see in a registration page and it gives me a idea on how

each input type work.</p><hr>

       <img src="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2b/images/tribute.png" id="content_img">

       <h3>Tribute: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/act47/tribute.html">VIEW HERE</a></h3>

       <p>This was one of activities in which I made a tribute for Larry Tesler because he just died in this year and he is one of the great scientist who made great contributions in our technologies and makes our lives easier.</p><hr>

       <img src="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/exam/part2b/images/vmg.png" id="content_img">

       <h3>Vision, Mision, Goals: <a href="https://jasonrado.github.io/Rado_WebDev_Midterm/vmg.html">VIEW HERE</a></h3><p>This was one of the activities that we are required to attach a video and audio of ourselves reciting the Vision, Mission, and Goals of University of Immaculate Conception</p>
